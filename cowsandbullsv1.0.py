'''===================================
Welcome to the Cows and Bulls Game!
===================================

Cows and bulls is a simple and brief
guessing game in which you have to
guess a randomly generated number of
four digits (0000 to 9999).

But don't worry! It won't be that hard!
Firstly, you'll have unlimited attempts to
correctly guess it. Also, you'll get some
clues allong the process.

If your guess is not entirely correct, but
get some numbers right, you'll earn cows
and bulls for each correct digit of your
answer.

Cows and bulls both represent right
number guessings, but the different
between them is that the cows also
represent right numbers guessings
at the right places, while bulls are right
numbers, but at wrong places.

Knowing your cows and bulls on each
attempt, you'll be one step closer into
unveilling the secret number.

Good luck and enjoy!!

[If you're not seeing the entire instructions
on this page, please scroll up.]

This is your secret number for this time:
